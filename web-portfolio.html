    <aboutme>
        <p>My name is Dylan Lainsbury, I am a grade 11 student interested in the field of computer programming and
        engineering. I am proficient in French, as I have lived in quebec briefly and took 9 years of 
        french immersion. I also have my National Lifeguard certification. I want to attend a Computer Science 
        program at the University of Ottawa, and in the future go into programming or engineering.</p>
